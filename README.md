# Skin-Cancer-Detection
Our Skin Cancer Detection project leverages deep learning and computer vision to distinguish between harmful (Malignant) and non-harmful (Benign) skin lesions. Using ResNet50 architecture and the HAM 10000 dataset, we achieve high accuracy in identifying potential malignancies.
